<h1>Security Assessment of MapChat Server and Client</h1>
<h3> Prepared by Yennie Jun  &nbsp;&middot;&nbsp;  Comp 20 Assignment 4 &nbsp;&middot;&nbsp;  December 1, 2015</h3>

<div id = "intro">
	<h2>Introduction</h2>
	<p> This assessment analyzes security vulnerabilities found in the MapChat application developed by Nolan Martin for <a href = "http://tuftsdev.github.io/WebProgramming/assignments/a4.html" target="_blank">Comp 20 Assignment 4</a>. MapChat is an application that allows users to "check-in" their location with a message of their choice. It also allows users to view a summary of all check-ins by a pre-determined set of "valid" users. MapChat provides APIs to check-in a certain location, to view a list of total check-ins (by time), and to search for the latest check-in of a login. However, vulnerabilities exist within the application that may pose as threats. This document explores specific vulnerabilities within the code and suggests solutions to reduce these threats.

<div id = "methodology">
	<h2>Methodology</h2>
	<p>Initially, I used the "black box" method. This means that I attacked popular attacks without looking at the source code. Eventually I used the "white box" method by looking at the source code for the client-side and server-side. All of my security testing was done by looking at the code and searching for vulnerabilities or logic errors. I used simple tools such as curl and the JavaScript Console part of Chrome Developer Tools. Using such simple tools and reading the source code, I was able to find multiple vulnerabilities.</p>
</div>


<div id = "abstract">
	<h2>Abstract of Findings </h2>
		<p>Many of the vulnerabilities stemmed from trusting user input too much. It is never a good idea to put trust into user input. </p>
</div>


<h2> Issues Found </h2>
	<ol> 


>>>>>>> master
	<li> <p class = "issue_name">Cross-Site Scripting </p>
	<ul>
		<li>Affects GET API (home page)</li>
		<li>Severity of issue: <span class = "high">high</span>. It is extremely easy for a hacker to inject HTML or JavaScript code by means of the POST API. The hacker can not only change the DOM tree (using HTML) but call malicious JavaScript functions.</li>

		<li>Data submitted via the POST API is not escaped, so it could include JavaScript or HTML injected as part of the message tag. For example, I ran the following: 
<<<<<<< HEAD
			<p><code> curl --data "login='mchow';lat=32;lng=29; message='&lt;script&gt;alert(You've been hacked!)&lt;/script&gt;'" https://fast-citadel-5360.herokuapp.com/sendLocation </code></p>
=======
			<p><code> curl --data "login='mchow';lat=32;lng=29; message='&lt;script&gt;alert(You have been hacked!)&lt;/script&gt;'" https://fast-citadel-5360.herokuapp.com/sendLocation </code></p>

			<p><img src = "xss_alert.png" alt = "Image of typical hacked alert" id = "xss_alert"></p>
>>>>>>> master

			<p>Similarly, one could submit any sort of data as part of the message.</p>
			<p><code> curl --data "login='mchow';lat=32;lng=29; message='&lt;!--'" https://fast-citadel-5360.herokuapp.com/sendLocation </code></p>
			<p>This commented out the rest of the entries of the log on the home page. To any other user, then, it looks like the database is missing entires, when in fact, it's just commented out.</p>

			<p> Even more maliciously, I can redirect everything to a whole new webpage just by using cross-site scripting and injecting some very simple JavaScript code, as such. </p>
<<<<<<< HEAD
			<p><code> curl --data "login='mchow';lat=32;lng=29; message='&lt;script&gt;window.location.replace("http://www.google.com")&lt;/script&gt;'" https://fast-citadel-5360.herokuapp.com/sendLocation </code></p>

		</li>

=======

			<p><code> curl --data "login='mchow';lat=32;lng=29; message='&lt;script&gt;window.location.replace("http://www.cs.tufts.edu")&lt;/script&gt;'" https://fast-citadel-5360.herokuapp.com/sendLocation </code></p>

		</li>

		<li>I was also able to inject script from the JavaScript Console through Chrome Developer Tools as well.
				<p><img src = "client_post1.png" alt = "Image of client posting data from JS console" id = "client_post"></p>
				<p><img src = "client_post2.png" alt = "Image of client posting data from JS console, on GET API" id = "client_post"></p>
		</li>

>>>>>>> master
		<li>Luckily, the only the data submitted as part of "message" tag is affected. The values for the keys "login", "lat", and "lng" are all checked for to make sure that they are valid values. </li>

		<li> Cross-site scripting is happening becasue the website is directly using user input. Hackers can get really malicious ideas - using cross-site scripting, it is not difficult to obtain session information stored in cookies, make modifications to the brwoser's DOM (as I did), or even access the user's geolocation, microphone, or webcam.</li>

<<<<<<< HEAD
		<li>Cross-site Scripting can be resolved by using escape syntax for the part of the HTML document that is receiving untrusted data. In this case, the "message" tag in the POST API. We can filter input by removing or replacing special characters such as <code> &lt; &gt; &quot; &#39; &amp; &#37; &#40; &#41; &#47;</code>. An example JavaScript function to do that would look something like 
		<pre> <code>str = str.replace(/\&lt;|\&gt;|\&quot;|\&#39;|\&#37;|\&#59;|\&#40;|\&#41;|\&amp;|\&#43;|\&#46;/g,""); </code> </pre></li>

	<li> <p class = "issue_name">Invalid Latitudes and Longitudes</p> 
		<ul> 
			<li>Affects connection with client. Issue found in POST and GET/latest.json API</li>

			<li>Severity of issue: <span class = "medium">medium</span>. Malicious attackers can post  invaluid latitudes or longitudes. These values are saved in the database, and the client will have trouble viewing these locations from Google Maps. </li>

	<li> <p class = "issue_name">Invalid Latitudes and Longitudes</p> 
		<ul> 
			<li>Affects connection with client. Affects Client-Side portion of website. Issue found in POST and GET/latest.json APIs.</li>

			<li>Severity of issue: <span class = "medium">medium</span>. Malicious attackers can post invaluid latitudes or longitudes. These values are saved in the database, and the client will have trouble viewing these locations from Google Maps. Invalid values will also affect the "distance" calculations in the client-side code.</li>
>>>>>>> master

			<li>Data submitted via the POST API as part of the lat and lng fields are not checked for valid input. For example, I ran the following:
				<p><code> curl --data "login='mchow';lat=32333;lng=-393929; message='I'm in outer space!" https://fast-citadel-5360.herokuapp.com/sendLocation </code></p>
				<p>The result when I open latest.json?login=mchow looks like this:</p>
<<<<<<< HEAD
				<p><img src = "bad_latlng.png" alt = "Image of bad lat and lng" id = "bad_latlng"></p>
			</li>


			<li>Luckily, it is very easy to fix this problem. In the POST API, an extra simple check can be included to filter out invalid  latitudes and longitudes. It can look something like:
				<p><code>if &#33;(lat &gt;&#61; -90.0 &amp;&amp; lat &lt;&#61; 90 &amp;&amp; lng &gt;&#61; -180 &amp;&amp; lng &lt;&#61; 180)

				 {response.send('{"error":"Whoops, something is wrong with the database connection"}');}</code></p>
				 <p>This problem can also be dealt with retroactively, in the GET API. However, the former option is a better one because it takes care of bad output from the start and does not need to waste space storing bad data.</p>
			</li>
		</ul>
	</li>

	<li> <p class = "issue_name">Something Else</p> 
		<ul> 
=======
				<p><div id = "bad_latlng"><img src = "bad_latlng.png" alt = "Image of bad lat and lng"></div></p>
			</li>


			<li>Obviously, those are not valid latitude and longitude points. Luckily, it is very easy to fix this problem. In the POST API, an extra simple check can be included to filter out invalid  latitudes and longitudes. It can look something like:
				<p><div class = "codeblock">
				<code class = "multiline">
				if &#33;(lat &gt;&#61; -90.0 &amp;&amp; lat &lt;&#61; 90 &amp;&amp; lng &gt;&#61; -180 &amp;&amp; lng &lt;&#61; 180) { 
					<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;response.send('{"error":"Whoops, something is wrong with the database connection"}');  
					<br>
					&nbsp;}</code></div></p>


				 <p>This problem can also be dealt with retroactively, in the GET API. It could also possibly be dealt with in the client-side code. However, the first option (checking for valid values wiht POST) is the best one because it takes care of bad output from the start and does not need to waste space storing bad data.</p>
			</li>
		</ul>
	</li>

	<li> <p class = "issue_name">CORS</p> 
		<ul> 
			<li>Affects posting of data from malicious or unwanted origins. Issue found in POST and GET APIs.</li>

			<li>Severity of issue: <span class = "medium">medium</span>. Malicious attackers can send data from any origin. This means that unwanted data from unwanted sources can be stored in the database and consequently retrieved in the GET API.</li>

			<li>For the GET and POST API, Cross-Origin Resrouce Sharing (CORS) was enabled, as such. 
				<p> <code> 	response.header('Access-Control-Allow-Origin', '*'); </code> </p>
				<p>This is vulnerable especially for the POST API. Using tools as simple as curl, I can send fake locations from any origin possible. For instance, I sent a location from the www.cs.tufts.edu origin.</p>
				<p><img src = "cors.png" alt = "Image of cors hack" id = "cors"></p>
			</li>

			<li>This is a pretty easy fix. Instead of using the wildcard * to allow all origins, only certain origins can be specified. In this case, we can specify the herokuapp server.</li>

		</ul>
	</li>


	<li> <p class = "issue_name">Unwanted Exposure of Personal Information at Client-Side</p> 
		<ul> 
			<li>Affects loss of unwanted personal information. Issue found in client-side Javascript function.</li>
			
			<li>Severity of issue: <span class = "low">low</span>. Using tools such as Chrome Developer Tools, users can extract data that the client perhaps did not wish to share through the JavaScript console, such as the client's location or contentString. Although the location is displayed on the map anyways, this may be information that the client wishes to keep private. </li>
			
			<li>In the client-side JavaScript code, variables such as MyLocation and contentString are kept as global variables. Thus, the information kept in these variables can be accessed from the JavaScript Console, which can be opened on nearly every browser. </li>
				<p><div id = "personal_exposed"><img src = "personal_exposed.png" alt = "Image of personal info exposed at client-side"></div></p>
			
			<li>The fixes for this problem can be optional, depending on if this problem is even viewed as a vulnerability or not. If this project is going to be built on and at some point this information needs to be kept private, it is a good idea to hide the information from any curious users. It can be easily fixed by making pertinent data not global variables. Again, this may not be considered a security vulnearbility at this stage of the project. A more pertinent threat may arise if this project is continued.</li>

<h2> Conclusion</h2>
=======
<div id = "conclusion"><h2> Conclusion</h2>
<p>Multiple security vulnerabilities exist with this version of MapChat. It is not difficult for malicious attackers to insert unwanted data into the database or render the webpage unusable for other users. Luckily, fixing these simple vulnerabilities will not cost too much. It just involves being more careful with allowing specific, certain data.</p>

<p>An important vulnerability I did not mention is that even with the correct specifications, any user can submit their location, and everyone can view everyone else's "check-ins". Therefore, I think it may be a good long-term goal to instantiate some way to check and verify users from an allowed list of users (perhaps authentication of some sort). That way, unwanted data need not be sent to the database using tools as simple as curl and the JavaScript Console.</p>
