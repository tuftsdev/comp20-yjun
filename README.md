# Portfolio for Tufts Comp 20 (Web Development)
### Yennie Jun
### Fall 2015 

## Purpose
The purpose of this Git repository is to showcase the work that I have done in this class. It is also to show the progress of my learning through this semester. 

## Favorite lab/assignment
Although it was the most stressful, the group project was my favorite assignment. It was difficult trying to find a time for everyone to meet, but I enjoyed creating my own project and planning it from scratch. It was also fun to use everything that I have learned in the class. 

## How much do you think you have grown from day 1 of this course to now?
I have definitely learned so much in this class. I definitely understand JavaScript and First Class Functions better (espeically since I was taking Comp 105, Programming Languages, at the same time). I think the polymorphism of JavaScript is really cool. I also learned that web dev is a subject that is always changing, espeically in today's day and age, and that there will always be something to learn from someone else. 

## Most important thing you learned in this course?
There are three important things I learned. One, never trust user input! I learned this through Assignment 3 as I hacked my opponent's code (and realized how vulnerable my own code for Assignment 2 had been). Two, the importance of resources such as Google and Stack Overflow as resources. The importance of such resources was reinforced with every assignment I did. Whenever I had an issue with MongoDB or API usage or JavaScript errors or anything, there was usually on StackOverflow who had asked the same question, and there was usually at least one helpful answer that fixed my problem. I found that for fixing bugs or clearing misunderstandings, Stack OverFlow had most of the answers. Three, I learned how to use GitHub (if not well, at least enough to pass by with). 

## What topic would you like to delve deeper into?
I wish to learn more about server side development (not just nodejs and Mongo). I would also like to learn to develop using Ruby and Python.
